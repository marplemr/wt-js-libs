/**
 * Dataset ready to use various strategies for storing the data
 * in a remote storage. Every field backed by this strategy should
 * have a getter and setter defined that interacts with the
 * remote storage. The dataset strategy may be in the following states:
 *
 * - fresh - Purely in-memory created object with no data
 * - unsynced - Some data may be set locally, but they were not
 * propagated to the remote storage, and no data was loaded from the
 * remote storage.
 * - deployed - Data has its representation ready on the remote storage
 * and we may call remote getters and setters to interact with the remote storage.
 * - obsolete - Data lost its representation on the remote storage and
 * we should not interact with it anymore.
 *
 * Internally a state is held for each property. If you `get` a property
 * that was not previously accessed, the whole dataset gets synced (this might
 * get more efficient in the future), and you get a current value from
 * the remote storage. If any value was changed locally, it is considered
 * as the current value. Once you are done with data modification, you
 * have to call `updateRemoteData` that propagates the whole dataset to the
 * remote storage. These calls are deduplicated, so if a single call is used
 * to update multiple properties, only once call is done.
